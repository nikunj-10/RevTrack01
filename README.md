# 2D to 3D Modeling

This subproduct converts 2D images from customer photo reviews into detailed 3D models. Walmart can leverage this technology to enhance the analysis of product issues and feedback. Customers simply upload their images, which are then transformed into interactive 3D models. This not only provides a clearer perspective on product faults but also reduces the effort required from customers, who no longer need to create 3D models manually.

## Features

- **3D Model Generation:** Automatically converts 2D customer review images into interactive 3D models.
- **Enhanced Visualization:** Offers a detailed and immersive view of product faults, aiding in more accurate assessments.
- **Customer Insights:** Facilitates effective communication of product issues or praise directly to sellers, based on detailed 3D visualizations.
- **Effortless Upload:** Simplifies the process for customers by allowing them to upload images without needing to create 3D models themselves.

## Benefits for Walmart

- **Improved Product Analysis:** Enables clear visualization of issues reported by customers, helping retailers to quickly identify and address faults.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Reduces customer effort and frustration by automating the 3D modeling process.
- **Efficient Feedback Handling:** Allows for direct and clear communication of customer feedback to sellers through detailed 3D models.


# Try it on Colab

Installing all the dependencies might be tricky and you need a computer with a CUDA enabled GPU. To get started fast you can just try [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13xkSkvPaF5GU6Wpf35nVHUdP77oBVHlT#scrollTo=xXxbMrF4fdZs) demo developed by [Mathias Gatti](https://github.com/mathigatti) using Google Colab.

# Dataset

We used the [ShapeNet](https://www.shapenet.org) dataset for 3D models, and rendered views from [3D-R2N2](https://github.com/chrischoy/3D-R2N2):</br>
When using the provided data make sure to respect the shapenet [license](https://shapenet.org/terms).

Below is the complete set of training data. Download it into the `Data/` folder.

The training/testing split can be found in `Data/train_list.txt` and `Data/test_list.txt` </br>
    
Each .dat file in the provided data contain: </br>
* The sampled point cloud (with vertex normal) from ShapeNet. We transformed it to corresponding coordinates in camera coordinate based on camera parameters from the Rendering Dataset.

# Training
    python train.py
You can change the training data, learning rate and other parameters by editing `train.py`

The total number of training epoch is 30; the learning rate is initialized as 3e-5 and drops to 1e-5 after 25 epochs.

# Evaluation
The evaluation code was released, please refer to `eval_testset.py` for more details.

Notice that the 3D shape are downscaled by a factor of 0.57 to generate rendering. As result, all the numbers shown in experiments used 0.57xRaw Shape for evaluation. This scale may be related to the render proccess, we used the rendering data from 3DR2N2 paper, and this scale was there since then for reason that we don't know.







# Blockchain Asset Tracking
A supply chain consists of many different participants exchanging goods, services, and payments. It is often desirable to track the physical assets digitally to be informed about the whereabouts, to trigger processes, certify the ownership, and perform corresponding payments.

The main four functions of this supply chain managment implementation is "Create Asset" , "Transfer Asset" ,"Search Asset" and "Delete Asset". also some minor functionalities include an event history of the four main functions and a login/signup/logout pages.
